# Speak-Sharp

```
Write a script under 10minutes for a faceless video for my YouTube channel "Speak Sharp". 

🎯 Topic: 

🎙️ Tone & Style:
– Confident, clear, slightly satirical — like a smart friend sharing a hard truth they learned the hard way
– Always based on a real-feeling short story, like a past situation or conversation
– Teaching tone, but casual and emotionally intelligent
– Blend attitude, empathy, and wit

🧠 Instructions:
– Do not include timestamps or script sections — write it as a plain, flowing script
– Must start with a micro-story or scenario from the past
– Use that story to teach a powerful communication insight, phrase, or mindset shift
– End with a mic-drop, perspective-shifting final line
– Every script must leave the viewer with something they can use or repeat in real life.
